                            The picture displayed above offers a glimpse into my daily life: Every day I open my Visual Studio Code Editor and work on 
                            my projects. The ones which are featured here on this website display the
                            array of different technologies, which I know how to use. If you are interested in the source code just check out my 
                           <a href="https://github.com/FloTheFlower">github account</a>.
                            Please feel free to explore the different apps, games and other projects
                             I have created using my beloved Visual Studio Code Editor. <br>
                            As for computers, I am used to working with Windows and my current latop is a Lenovo (Windows 10 Pro). Brand-wise 
                            I also really enjoy DELL. <br>
