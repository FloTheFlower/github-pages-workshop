## What I do, when I don't code...
<i> So now that you know what I currently work on, I can tell you some other things about me. </i>

* Theatre: My favourite playwrite of all times is Henrik Ibsen. My favourite contemporary playwrite is Yasmina Reza(She is famous for her works "Art" and "God of Carnage"). My favourite American playwrite contemporary playwrite is Lauren Yee, my favourite all time American playwrite is Arthur Miller. San Diego has many theatres to offer. So far I explored "La Jolla Playhouse" and "Cygnet Theatre" in Old Town.

* Gym: My husband and I love to work out. We try to go to the gym four times a week, if there isn't enough time though, we work out at home. In the warmer season I also love to water ski and currently I am improving my skills in wakeboarding. San Diego is a great place for that! 

* Literature: I love to read, especially theatre plays. However nothing is like a good novel. Since I moved to the US I discoverd the works of William Faulkner and "Light in August" swept me of my feet. 

* Cinema: Although I was a bigger movie fanatic when I was younger, I still enjoy going to the movies a lot. During my time in film school I produced my share of short movies, even winning a price one time. So whenever I am in the movies I can't help but also consider the lightning, the editing, the directing and the costumes. One of my favourite filmmakers is Alejandro González Iñárritu. 

* Learning new (natural and programming) languages: German is my mother tongue and English is my everyday language. Apart from those two I am also fluent in Spanish and pretty well versed in French. Since I spent quite some time in Moscow and took some Russian classes, I have some knowledge of Russian as well.
