## What I do, when I don't code...
*Now that you know some of my programming projects, I can tell you other things about me.*

* Code for America: I am active in the San Diego Chapter of *Code for America* which is called <a href="https://opensandiego.org/"> Open San Diego </a>, where we meet every Tuesday evening for two hours in Downtown. There we discuss and work on community projects for the city. At the moment we work on sustainability projects where we use the open-source data which are collected by <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/sustainability/energy-and-water-efficiency/programs-projects/smart-city"> San Diego's Smart City Lights </a>. (Okay I admit it: That was code-related again. But the following points, won't be...)

* Theatre: My favorite play-write of all time is Henrik Ibsen. My favorite contemporary play-write is Yasmina Reza. (Reza is famous for her works "Art" and "God of Carnage".) My favorite all-time American play-write is Arthur Miller. San Diego has many theatres to offer. So far I explored "La Jolla Playhouse" and "Cygnet Theatre" in Old Town. Since I am here I already saw two plays of the contemporary play-write Lauren Yee. I liked them a lot, so I started to follow her work more. 

* Gym: My husband and I love to work out. We try to go to the gym four times a week, if there isn't enough time though, we work out at home. In the warmer season, I also love to water ski and currently I am improving my skills in wakeboarding. San Diego is a great place for that! 

* Literature: I love to read, especially theatre plays, but also novels. Since I moved to the US I discovered the works of William Faulkner and "Light in August" swept me off my feet. 

* Cinema: Although I was a bigger movie fanatic when I was younger, I still enjoy going to the movies a lot. During my time in film school, I produced my share of short movies, even winning a price one time. So whenever I am in the movies I can't help but also consider the lighting, the editing, the directing and the costumes. One of my favorite filmmakers is Alejandro González Iñárritu. 

* Learning new (natural and programming) languages: German is my mother tongue and English is my everyday language. Apart from those two, I am also fluent in Spanish and pretty well versed in French. Since I spent quite some time in Moscow and took some Russian classes, I have some knowledge of Russian as well.
