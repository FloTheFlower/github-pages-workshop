While I was working for the German tech-magazine <a href="https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/"> DIGITALE WELT </a> I learned a lot about new technologies like quantum-computing. However, instead of writing about it, I actually wanted to be one of those people doing the magic and bringing the future into existence. Although I am still at the very beginning of my coding-career, I feel a thrill about having changed my viewpoint. Instead of looking from the outside in, now, I am up close. Creating my own projects makes me understand software on a whole new level. Being one of those magicians who is able to create products by writing code, is a dream come true. 

## A long way…

During my time at the magazine (which was part of the Computer Science Department of the University of Munich), I took a Java class and several introductory classes to Computer Science as a visiting student. I learned basic concepts like for-loops, while-loops, etc. However, I never really found the time to dedicate myself to real projects. Once I moved to the United States, I took the chance and gave coding another shot, now with more dedication and time. Although the process of learning to code is a very time-intensive and challenging one, I would absolutely take the same decision again. Especially since my first web-app is up and running. Everyone who has once experienced it will know that few things in life feel as satisfying as  having an application up and running, on which you have worked on for several weeks or even months.
