When I was working for the German tech-magazine “DIGITALE WELT” I learned a lot about NEW technologies like quantum-computing. However, instead of writing about it, I actually wanted to be one of those people doing the magic and bringing the future into existence. Although I am still at the very beginning of my coding-career, I feel a thrill about having changed my viewpoint. Instead of looking form the outside in, I am now making my own projects, being up close and understanding software on another level. Being part of those magicians, being able to bring things into existence which previously didn’t exist, by writing code, is a dream come true. 

## A long way…

During my time at the magazine (which was located in the Computer Science Department of the University of Munich), I did take a Java class and learned some basic concepts like for-loops, while-loops, etc. However, I never really found the time to dedicate myself to bigger projects. Once I moved to the US, I took the chance and tried it again, now with more dedication and more time. Although the process of learning how to code is a very time-intensive and at times scary one, I would absolutely take the same decision again. Few things in my life feel like having an application up and running, on which you have worked on for several weeks.
