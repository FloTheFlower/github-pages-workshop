## Gitlab

**Git commit...**



At the one company I am working for – *Jan Kath* – we are using Github. For the other company I am currently working for – *LifeStyleMate* – we are using Gitlab. If you can work the one version control and its repositories, you will be able to figure out the other one really quickly.

Before joining *LifeStyleMate* I had no prior experience with Gitlab. These “version control repository management services” as they are formally known, are very similar in most of there functionalities. However, I personally enjoy the Gitlab interface better. I seems more structured to me. What I enjoy most, that it is – at least for me – quicker to find the last commit. Jumping between merge requests and branches, which are not yet opened in a merge request seems more intuitive to me. I also enjoy how the deployment to production works. I cannot tell why, but the moment when you tag the branch, the moment, before you push your code out into the world seems less scary to me on Gitlab than on Github. 
However, since GitHub was what I learnt first, while I was still attending bootcamp, it feels like the “the original” version control service to me.
