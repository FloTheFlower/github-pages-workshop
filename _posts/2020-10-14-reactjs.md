 **Meet you on my sofa...**

Today I attended the first React.JS meeting after not joining any during the summer months. Although I was sitting in my living room instead of some fancy office building where these meetings are usually held, I was surprised about how similar the meetings were structured to the in-person ones. (I am still tempted to write “real” instead of in-person….) 
Because we could not interact and chat the way we would usually do before the talks begin, the attendees played the game “GeoGuesser” instead to check how well we know San Diego. This was a lot of fun and a great ice breaker. (Just like the child’s voice chiming in and asking its parent attending the meeting for food, before being muted…)  
The main talk was titled: “Will it re-render?” focused mostly on how react renders items. The presenter focused then on memoization in React and the advantages of the useMemo-hook. I have used useMemo before and also had read quite a lot about it, so I could make good sense of the talk. 
 
 **Overall impression**

Even though I felt a bit of a Covid-gloom among the attendees of this meetup, I was happy that I attended. I feel it is important to stay in touch with the community, to keep being active and not to sink too far into the home office bubble.
