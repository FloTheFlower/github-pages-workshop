Every Tuesday I meet with the people from <a href="https://opensandiego.org/">Open San Diego </a>, the San Diego Chapter of *Code for America*. We make civic projects for San Diego, as for example the *Meals Count Project*. Herby weâ€™re building a web-based tool California school districts can use to optimize free meal program participation and federal reimbursement, in partnership with California Food Policy Advocates and San Diego Hunger Coalition. I could help with front end issues. 

## Real world project 
Although I had built real world projects before, I had never before worked in a team with Senior-software-developers before. So the only time I had truley pulled from Github before that was with collegues from my coding-bootcamp-cohort. Working with people who have more than twelve years of experience is amazing! I learn so much in such a short time. Since the members of 'Open San Diego' are volunteers and have dayjobs, we communicated via Slack in the mornings and in the evenings. 

## Vue and Webpack
Since 'Meal Count' is done with Vue and I had never used it before, I had to dedicate an entire day of watching Vue-Crashcourse-Tutorials to be able to truley help. Espcially because inserting images in Vue is a little trickier than in Angular, because one has to handle Webpack for it. Although I had touched webpack in tutorials and in class before, I also needed to refresh my knowledge on it. Especially the concept of the webpack file-loader was new to me and I had to explore it, before I could proceed. 

It is an amazing opportunity to improve my coding skills and at the same time work on a project which potentially can help avoid children being hungry in school. I am very happy that I found Open San Diego.
