Every Tuesday I meet with the people from <a href="https://opensandiego.org/">Open San Diego </a>, the San Diego Chapter of <a href="https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/"> Code for America Brigade</a>. We work on projects for the public good of San Diego, for example, the *Meals Count Project*. Hereby weâ€™re building a web-based tool California school districts can use to optimize free meal program participation and federal reimbursement, in partnership with California Food Policy Advocates and San Diego Hunger Coalition. I could help with front end issues. 

## Real world project 
Although I had built real-world projects for small businesses in the past, I had never before worked in a team with Senior-software-developers. So the only time I had truly pulled from Github before was with students from my coding-Bootcamp-cohort. Working with people who have more than twelve years of experience and sending them "real" pull requests is amazing! I learn so much in such a short amount of time. Since the members of *Open San Diego* are volunteers and have day jobs, we communicated exclusively via Slack. 

## Vue and Webpack
Since *Meal Count* is done in Vue and I had never used Vue before, I had to dedicate an entire day to watching Vue-Crashcourse-Tutorials, to be able to truly help. That was necessary because somethings in Vue are a little trickier than in Angular.  For example, I had to use Webpack to insert pictures. Although I had touched Webpack in tutorials and in-class before, I needed to refresh my knowledge on it. Especially the concept of the Webpack file-loader was new to me and I had to explore it before I could proceed. 

It is an amazing opportunity to improve my coding skills while working on something which potentially helps to avoid children going hungry in school. I am very happy that I found Open San Diego. 

## Map 
With the help of the Senior Software Developer of the team we inserted a map of the United States with the library d3 and us-atlas. We wrote some logic that the states, for which we do have existing data, fills green, while the other ones are greyed out. A

## Modal 
I wrote a new modal-component which pops up, whenever you click on a state where we don't have data for yet. 

## Learnings
