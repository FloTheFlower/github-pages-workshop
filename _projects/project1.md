Go to <https://flotheflower.github.io/SearchGame> to play my **smiley search game**!  

## MY FIRST GAME

The **search game** is the first little game I ever coded.  


## Key Takeaways from this Project

1. Generating a random generator using Math.random().
2. Working with the DOM: appending children and deleting one. 
3. Designing the background in CSS with a picture.
