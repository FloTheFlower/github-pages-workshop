This was my first major project. I worked on it for several weeks. Since I am movie fanatic, I enjoyed working on this project a lot. You could probably compare it to a small scale version of IMDb. The API used for this project is open source: <https://www.themoviedb.org/>

## Learnings

1. Setting up and using the backend and everything that comes with it....
2. Authentication: Using tokens and userId for login, register, favourite movies, etc. 
3. Using an open source API. (An API key was required, however it is granted to everyone who creates an account at themoviedb.org)
4. Using a CSS-framework other than Bootstrap. Project Clarity has it's pitfalls, but all in all it works pretty well.

## Features of Movie Admirers
Usercs can search for movies in the search bar. If they create an account, they can also store their favourite movies or delete them.
