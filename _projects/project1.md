Check out *Movie Admirers* here: <https://florentina-hofbauer-database.netlify.com/logIn>

*Movie Admirers* was my first major project. You could probably compare it to a small scale version of IMDb. The API used for this project is open source: <https://www.themoviedb.org> I worked on *Movie Admirers* for several weeks. Since I love movies, I enjoyed this project a lot. 

## Learnings

1. Setting up and using the backend and everything that comes with it....
2. Authentication: Using tokens and userId for login, register, favorite movies, etc. 
3. Using an open source API. (An API key was required, however it is granted to everyone who creates an account at themoviedb.org)
4. Using a CSS-framework other than Bootstrap. Project Clarity has it's pitfalls, but all in all it works pretty well.

## Features of Movie Admirers
* If the user creates an account, he/she can search for movies in the search bar.  
* If the user creates an account, he/she can store their favorite movies in a seperate list or delete them. 
* The result page displays the release year, the summary and the audience-rank of each movie.
