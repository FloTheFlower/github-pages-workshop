Go to <https://FlorentinaMargarita.github.io/Lebenslauf/> to see **my life in pictures**. This was the first project I ever built.

## Trying out features in CSS

If you refresh the page, you will see that the background colors change. 

**Playing with CSS features**

* In this project I mostly played and tried out different CSS features. I enjoyed playing with the sticky-position, however, I thought it looked unorganized so at the end of the day I decided to use the absoulte position for the circles. 
* Doing this excercise set me up to easily learn Bootstrap, with which I built the next project.
